title: Welcome to Hiking by Transit
---

Part of the joy of living in the Bay Area for me has always been how close I am to natural places in their infinite variety. Our lands feature everything from cool, damp redwood forests to rolling oak savannahs, and one of the most incredible parts of living here is how much of it is public land -- *our* land -- open for anyone to explore.

However, at the same time, it's always frustrated me how difficult it can be to get to our region's preserves and open spaces by transit. Over the years, I've become quite adept at it, and compiled my own list of trailheads I've found ways to get to without a car. I hope that in sharing this with you, I can share the joy of our open spaces.

The hikes listed here are meant to serve as inspiration for your own adventures. Pick a trailhead, pack a map, and get out there!
