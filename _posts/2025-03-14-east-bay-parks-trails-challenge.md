Every year, the East Bay Regional Parks District puts on their annual [Trails Challenge](https://www.ebparks.org/trails-challenge). Now in its 32nd year, the Challenge is both an encouragement to get out on the trails, with a mileage goal and a trail count goal, and a guide suggesting a variety of hikes to go on suitable for people of all levels of hiking comfort.

<!-- excerpt -->

One of the most special parts of the East Bay Regional Parks is how integrated into our neighborhoods they are. Where houses end, parks begin, and this means that you can walk right off the bus and upto the trailhead at many of the trails in this year's Trails Challenge guidebook.

This post is intended as an unofficial companion for the official [Trails Challenge 2025 guidebook](https://www.ebparks.org/sites/default/files/TC-2025-Guidebook-web.pdf): more information about the following hikes is available there.

### Shadow Cliffs Regional Recreation Area

Former gravel quarry pits now form peaceful lakes at this Pleasanton-area park. In the spring, visit for wildflowers; in hotter months, though the trails are exposed, the lakes and surrounding trees help keep the area somewhat cooler than paved urbanized areas. The bus stops directly at the park entrance, and the hike is minimally hilly with the tallest hill being that from the entrance on Stanley Blvd down into the park.

**Intensity**: Easy

**Travel time**: 18min on Wheels 10

**From**: Dublin/Pleasanton BART

**Length**: 2.4 miles, including 0.1mi each way to/from the bus

### Contra Loma Regional Park

Contra Loma Reservoir, the highlight feature of this regional park, was built in the 1960s as an emergency water supply for the area. Today, its shores are home to grasses, trees, and local fowl, including migratory waterfowl and year-round residents like the California quail. This hike around the rim of the reservoir shows off the park's features, from the swim lagoon and boat launch to the less-traveled, peaceful eastern side. The nearest all-week bus stop is located just under a half mile away from the entrance to the adjoining Antioch Community Park, but on weekdays the bus stops directly at the Community Park's entrance.

**Intensity**: Moderate

**Travel time**: 37min on Tri Delta 380

**From**: Pittsburg Center BART

**Length**: 3.9 miles, including 0.4mi each way to/from bus

The Dry Creek Staging Area is located approximately 600 feet up May Rd from the intersection of Mission Blvd. Part of the staging area driveway has no sidewalks, but a gravel shoulder provides a space to walk out of the path of traffic.

**Intensity**: Moderate

**Travel time**: 7min on AC Transit 99

**From**: Union City BART

**Length**: 5.3 miles, including 600 feet each way to/from bus

### Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline

This park, located just through the Point Richmond Tunnel from Richmond's most quaint neighborhood, is located at the former terminus of the Santa Fe transcontinental railroad. This hike starts at the Keller Beach before looping around the park's pond and heading up to several of the peaks of the 371-foot hill separating it from the bustle of the city and port, from which San Francisco, Mount Tamalpais, and the surrounding bayshore and islands can be seen.

The park is located a short walk from central Point Richmond and the 72M bus, with the walk heading through the historic tunnel on a separated, raised multi-use path.

**Intensity**: Moderate

**Travel time**: 20min on AC Transit 72M

**From**: El Cerrito del Norte BART

**Length**: 3.1 miles, including 0.3mi each way to/from bus
