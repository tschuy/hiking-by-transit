AC Transit is bringing back service on its Line 7, serving the East Bay hills along Arlington Blvd, connecting to the Rifle Ridge Road trailhead at Wildcat Canyon Regional Park.

Come celebrate the restoration of this weekend service with me on August 20th! Meet at Downtown Berkeley BART at the Plaza at 10:30am -- we'll take the 7 up into the hills from there.
