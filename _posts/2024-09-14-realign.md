title: What does AC Transit Realign mean for recreational access in the East Bay?
---

AC Transit is currently redesigning its bus network in a project called [AC Transit Realign](https://www.actransit.org/realign). The process is nearly finished, and there are important and positive ramifications for access to the outdoors in the inner part of the East Bay.

<!-- excerpt -->

## New service to the redwoods

By far the most important change to recreational access in AC Transit service proposed with Realign is the introduction of weekend service to Joaquin Miller Rd & Skyline Blvd around Joaquin Miller Park, Redwood Regional Park, and the Chabot Space and Science Center.

The extended Line 21, taking over and extending weekday-only Line 39 service, will reintroduce long-lost service to the main (middle elevation) entrances to Joaquin Miller, including the cascade and community center; the Roberts Recreation Area, including recently-renovated pool and sports facilities; the upland Redwood Glen of Joaquin Miller with its most majestic redwoods; the Redwood Bowl staging area, with immediate access to the East Bay Parks’ Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park; and the Chabot Space & Science Center itself, along with the West Ridge Trail passing through.

## Two parks become further away

One park does see removal of bus service near its main entrance, but there remain ways to access it otherwise:

* **Quarry Lakes**: no longer served by Line 216 near the main entrance; nearest access is now via BART (26min walk) or via Niles Community Park (still served by Line 216) 

One park sees service moved further away, but still within extended walking distance:

* **Kennedy Grove**: nearest Line 74 stop now 0.9mi instead of 0.3mi

## Minor changes in frequency and routes

Some parks see an increase in frequency:

* **Dry Creek**: frequency increased from 30min to 15min on weekends; will be served by Line 10 instead of Line 99
* **Cull Canyon**: Line 28 increased from 60min to 40min all-week service
* **Chabot**: Line 34 & Line 35 weekday frequency both increased from 60min to 40min weekday; weekend service remains 60min

Several parks see a reduction in effective frequency:

* **Tilden**: Line 65 reduced from 40min weekday to 45min weekday service; Line 67 reduced from 30min weekday to 60min weekday service
* **Garin**: Line 60 reduced from 40min all-week to 45min all-week service
* **Vargas Plateau**: keeping 30min all-week service on Line 217, losing Line 60min all-week service on Line 232
* **Mission Peak**: keeping 30min all-week service on Line 217; loss of some weekday-only service on Line 239

Several parks just see the route that serves them combined into another route:

* **Claremont Canyon**: will be served by Line 36 instead of Line 79
* **Joaquin Miller** at Palos Colorados Trailhead (Montclair): will be served by Line 18 instead of Line 33

Some parks, like Dimond Canyon and Leona Canyon, do not see any service change.

## Tilden remains unserved

Tilden and Sibley, two of the East Bay Regional Park District’s most important parks just uphill from Berkeley, continue to be entirely inaccessible by transit on weekends. Line 67 ran special weekend service into Tilden Regional Park to the Brazilian Room until COVID.
