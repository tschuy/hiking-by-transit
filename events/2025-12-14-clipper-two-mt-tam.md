It's never been a better deal to take transit to the hike than with Clipper 2.0's free transfers!

Come join at the start in Oakland, or at any point along the way!

### Hike details

This hike takes old railroad grades up to the visitor center at the East Peak. The grade is quite consistent, but there is significant elevation gain (approximately 1500ft).

Be prepared for 7.8mi distance and 1500ft of elevation gain!
