*Overview*: For those in the know, Dimond Canyon is one of the highlights of the City of Oakland’s extensive parks system. Starting right in the heart of the vibrant Dimond neighborhood, where pre-hike pizza, coffee, or pastries await, an urban park with pool and play structures quickly gives way to a rugged canyon trail. In a short distance, we’ll hike up into a creekbed, under a historic bridge, and through redwoods on our way upland. We’ll then loop through the city’s impressive Joaquin Miller Park, named for the Poet of the Sierras who once owned and lived in the forest, through some of the most impressive redwoods in the city and past fantastic views of the San Francisco Bay and San Francisco skyline. We’ll then finish up the day in Montclair, where pizza and a ride home awaits.

​This hike is 6.2 miles with 1450 feet of elevation gain.

​If you want to join but there is too much distance, elevation, or time, a shorter 3-mile option is available by removing the Joaquin Miller loop. We can point you towards Montclair after Dimond Canyon.
