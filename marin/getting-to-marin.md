<h1>Getting to Marin</h1>

<p class="message">
    There are several hikes in Marin that are easy to get to from San Francisco without making a transfer. Check out <a href="/hikes/angel-island">Angel Island</a> for world-class views from an island one quick ferry away, or go hiking in the Headlands along the ridge above Sausalito on <a href="/hikes/headlands-marin-city">the SCA Trail</a>!
</p>

To get outdoors in Marin, it can feel like you have to become a transit planner. Transit in the Bay Area generally does a very good job at having timetables and real-time data on Google Maps, Apple Maps, and the Transit app, so simply using those apps to determine how to get to a specific trailhead is perfectly doable. However, if you know which buses serve the trailheads you are considering, you can understand how many transfers and how long it might take to get to a given park more easily.

**When riding Golden Gate Transit and Marin Transit buses, it's important to tag on when you board and tag off when you get off.** The buses charge distance-based fares, and forgetting to tag off can result in a much higher fare than expected. If you forget to tag off, you can contact Clipper customer sevice for a refund of the excess.

## Getting around Marin

There are parks everywhere in Marin. The most famous, however, are mainly located along the two West Marin Stagecoach routes 61 and 68.

### Muir Woods Shuttle

The Shuttle is the easiest and most convenient way to get to world-famous Muir Woods. Operating only during the peak season, around March to October, the shuttle runs from the Larkspur ferry terminal to the central Muir Woods Visitor Center. 

### Marin Transit 61

Route 61 serves Mount Tamalpais, Muir Woods, and beaches from Stinson Beach up to the Bolinas Lagoon. The major transfer points for Route 61 are the Sausalito Ferry Terminal (GGT 130 and Sausalito Ferry) and the Marin City Hub (GGT 130 & GGT 150).

### Marin Transit 68

Route 68 serves Samuel P. Taylor State Park, Tomales Bay State Park, and Point Reyes National Seashore. The major transfer point for Route 68 is San Rafael Transit Center.

## From San Francisco

If the ferry schedule lines up with your plans, it is by far the most alluring way to go hiking. For hiking directly off the ferry, Angel Island cannot be bested; Old St. Hilary's Preserve and the Morning Sun Trailhead in the Headlands are just over a half-hour walk from the Tiburon and Sausalito ferry terminals respectively, but otherwise you will need to transfer to a bus, in which case it's almost certainly better to take a Golden Gate Transit bus from San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge. Golden Gate Transit runs buses half-hourly or better for most most of the day seven days a week, but not all routes serve all transit centers.

The 61 is not timed to meet ferries in Sausalito. However, it's a cute town that over a million people visit every year, so it would be entirely reasonable to take a ferry to Sausalito and wander around until the next departure.

## From the East Bay

East Bay to Marin transit is possible either via the Golden Gate Transit 580 bus across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, or by heading into San Francisco and taking buses from the Salesforce Transit Center. The following charts describe connections from buses heading westbound across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.

[Read more about the 580 bus on Golden Gate Transit's website »](https://www.goldengate.org/bus/route-schedule/del-norte-bart-station-san-rafael-580/)

Like to ride your bike? There are secure bicycle lockers available at San Rafael Transit Center on Tamalpais Ave just north of 4th St for $0.05/hour through the BikeLink app. It's around 11.6mi one way from the Richmond BART station to the bike lockers in San Rafael, and you can ride one way and bring your bike on the bus the other way.
