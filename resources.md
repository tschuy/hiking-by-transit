This website is by no means the end-all, be-all of getting out into nature on transit. Some other resources that I've found continually helpful for myself have been:

* [Transit Trekker](https://transittrekker.com/transit-trekking-resources/): another transit hiker who has put together links to resources like this one, for cities across the country

* [California Public Lands map](https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/f73858e200634ca888b19ca8c78e3aed_0/explore?location=37.856492%2C-121.985920%2C11.00): a map from CalFire showing all of the public land in the state
