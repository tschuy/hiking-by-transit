title: Media Coverage

This page is really for me. It's been exciting to see so much positive feedback, and getting media coverage was definitely not something I expected when I launched this site.

In August 2025, for the launch of AC Transit's Realign bus network redesign, I wrote an op-ed in the SF Chronicle discussing why it's so important that transit agencies prioritize service to parks to show that transit can be a way to live, not just a way to get by.

The Mercury News covered Hiking by Transit mere days after it was first published, which was a bit of a shock to me and hugely exciting. The article was in-depth, useful as both a tool for people to learn about hike options and to advocate for better accessibility to the hills:

The San Francisco Standard also gave the site a shout-out as a nice light "things to do" piece, mostly running down some of the highlights of the site:

As part of a program on Awe Walks and the benefits of getting outdoors, local NPR affiliate KALW had me on an episode of the State of the Bay. It was great get a chance to discuss how transit isn't just *a* way to get outdoors, for the right hike it's the *better* way to get outdoors. Being car-free is freeing!
