blurb: Consistently one of the country's most-visited national parks, Yosemite deserves its fame. Its towering giant sequoias are dwarfed only by its immense granite cliffs and waterfalls. Buses serve the park year-round from Merced; routes to the Mariposa Grove, the Eastern Sierras, and Fresno are seasonal (May to September).

Consistently one of the country's most-visited national parks, Yosemite deserves its fame. Its towering giant sequoias are dwarfed only by its immense granite cliffs and waterfalls. Buses serve the park year-round from Merced; routes to the Mariposa Grove, the Eastern Sierras, and Fresno are seasonal (May to September).

### Getting to Yosemite from the San Francisco Bay Area

To get to the Yosemite Valley from the Bay Area, take the Amtrak San Joaquins and transfer to a YARTS bus in Merced. *The trip takes six hours or more*, depending on the itinerary chosen; tickets can be booked through the [Amtrak website](https://www.amtrak.com/) or from a ticket agent.

Book tickets in advance; YARTS offers both reservations and walk-on service, but there is a discount for passengers transfering from Amtrak, and the walk-on service does not guarantee space.

In the Yosemite Valley, YARTS offers service to the three main lodging areas at Curry Village, Yosemite Village, and the Yosemite Valley Lodge.

### Getting to Yosemite from Fresno

During summer season, YARTS offers service from Fresno to the Yosemite Valley. For passengers coming via Amtrak, book tickets through the [Amtrak website](https://www.amtrak.com/) or from a ticket agent; for passengers coming from the Fresno Yosemite Airport, tickets can be booked on [the YARTS website](https://yarts.com/routes/fresno-hwy-41/).

### Getting around the Park

The National Park Service runs a free shuttle system around the Valley with access to trailheads, campgrounds and hotels, and restaurants. Without a car, Glacier Point is only accessible via a [9.6mi round trip](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/fourmiletrail.htm) hike, and the Mariposa Grove and Wawona Lodge and Store are only accessible during summer with the [YARTS Fresno/Hwy 41](https://yarts.com/routes/fresno-hwy-41/) bus is running. Trails along Tioga Road to Tuolumne Meadows can be reached in the summer using the Yosemite Valley-Tuolumne Meadows Hikers Bus. For more information, [see the National Parks Service's guide to public transportation in Yosemite National Park](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/publictransportation.htm). 

### Transit accessible lodging

Hotels and campgrounds in the Valley can be reached year-round; Wawona Lodge can only be reached when the YARTS Fresno/Hwy 41 bus is running. [See the National Parks Service's guide to lodging in Yosemite National Park](https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/lodging.htm).
