Coyote Valley Open Space Preserve offers views over Morgan Hill from its grassy and oaky shoulder. Unfortunately, this preserve currently has no access into nearby Rancho Cañada del Oro, nor into the bordering Tilton Ranch Preserve, which was recently acquired and is in the early stages of being publicly managed.

At the right time of year, you can expect to see the state flower, the California poppy, along with lots of other wildflowers.
