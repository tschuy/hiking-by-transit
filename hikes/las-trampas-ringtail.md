County Connection buses 21 (weekday) and 321 (weekend) serve this trailhead. Transfer at Walnut Creek BART.

Las Trampas Regional Wilderness was a surprise to me. It's just off to the side of Danville, a cute, unassuming, well-to-do suburb that I'd mostly been to on the way to Mount Diablo. The first time I went the other way and headed up the ridgeline back towards the Bay I was blown away. The views from the ridge are incredible and the wildflowers are stunning. In just one hike Las Trampas became one of my favorite places to escape to in the East Bay.
