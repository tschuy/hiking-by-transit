Tahoe, from Washo dáʔaw, simply means *lake*, and cobalt-blue Lake Tahoe truly is *the* lake. The largest alpine lake in North America, it attracts visitors from around the world every season of the year for its skiing, hiking, and water sports in a dramatic mountain setting.

The following transportation information is a summary. More comprehensive information on mountain bike, ski, and resort shuttle services around the Tahoe area can be found on [Keep Tahoe Blue's website](https://www.keeptahoeblue.org/) (which has a particularly detailed section on winter transportation) and on the excellent [Linking Tahoe](https://www.linkingtahoe.com/) website, run by the Tahoe Regional Planning Association.

### Understanding the Tahoe region

There are two main routes into the Tahoe area: from the north, I-80 and Amtrak run from Sacramento (or Reno) through Donner Pass and the city of Truckee; from the south, US-50 runs from Sacramento through Echo Pass to South Lake Tahoe.

Truckee is located a 12-15mi drive from the lake itself on Hwy 89 (to Tahoe City) or Hwy 267 (to Kings Beach). Each of these roads sees hourly service on TART, the transit agency for the northern half of the lake. Tahoe City and Kings Beach, plus Incline Village are the main towns in the north, but contiguous vacation developments span much of the western and northern shores.

South Lake Tahoe is sited directly on the lake, and along with Stateline and Kingsbury forms a largely contiguous sprawling town at the heart of the southern shore. South Lake is a major ski center, and as such has a modern faux urbanist center at Heavenly Village, but it is not a particularly walkable town.

Tahoe City to South Lake Tahoe is 30 miles on what is in parts a winding mountain highway. There is minimal transit between the two shorelines; in the summer, the Emerald Bay State Park shuttle service can be used to get down the western shoreline, while in the winter, the only possible option requires going to Reno.

As such, it's important to decide early on in planning any Tahoe trip what activities to do, and where to do them.

### Getting to the lake

#### North Lake

The [Capitol Corridor](https://www.capitolcorridor.org/) runs thruway buses twice a day that stop in Truckee from Sacramento in the west and Reno in the east. These buses each connect to specific train for connecting to the San Francisco area; check the arrival time on the bus, as one of the two daily buses arrives in Truckee after the last Tahoe-bound bus has already departed. Tickets from Emeryville are $50 for the first adult, with a 50% discount available for people traveling with them.

Amtrak's [California Zephyr](https://www.amtrak.com/california-zephyr-train) train runs once daily from the San Francisco area through Truckee. Eastbound, the train is fairly reliable, but westbound trains originate in Chicago and are notorious for racking up delays over the course of the long journey. Tickets from Emeryville start at around $50 per adult but go up in price as more are sold.

[North Lake Tahoe Express](https://northlaketahoeexpress.com/) shuttles are available from the Reno Tahoe International Airport to places all around the Truckee and North Lake area, with service 2-5 times a day depending on the destination. Tickets are $99 for the first adult, but go down to as low as $55 per for a group of 5.

#### South Lake

El Dorado Transit runs a once-daily [Sacramento/South Lake Tahoe connecting bus](https://eldoradotransit.com/sacramento-south-lake-tahoe-connecting-bus/) that connects to the Capitol Corridor for connecting to the San Francisco area. Tickets can be booked through Amtrak, and tickets from Emeryville are $66 for the first adult, with a 50% discount available for people traveling with them.

The [South Tahoe Airporter](https://southtahoeairporter.com/) shuttle runs several times a day from the Reno Tahoe International Airport to Stateline (directly adjacent to South Lake Tahoe). Tickets are $33.25 per adult at the time of writing.

### Getting around the region

North Lake and Truckee's transit service is operated by TART. TART is fare-free for both fixed-route services along the highways, and for TART Connect microtransit.

The seasonal, summer-only [Emerald Bay Shuttle](https://www.keeptahoeblue.org/emerald-bay-shuttle/) connects to both TART (at Sugar Pine Campground) and TTD (at the "Y" Transit Center).
