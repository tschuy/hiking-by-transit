Angel Island is located in the middle of the San Francisco Bay, just off the end of the Tiburon peninsula. Its strategic location has meant that it has played an outsized role in the history of immigration and war. Since the end of World War II, nearly the whole island has become a state park, with only small sections remaining active Coast Guard uses.

As a place that is simultaneously a historical park and a nature preserve, the island has something for everyone. Of particular historical interest are the Angel Island Immigration Station, with a museum detailing the history of the 500,000 immigrants who passed through and the conditions they were held in; the crumbling remains of the early 20th century Fort McDowell; and the remains of Civil War era Camp Reynolds, originally established to counter Confederate threats against the Bay Area.

All of these historical sites are conveniently located along the main Perimeter Road, a paved 5.5mi road (open only to hikers, cyclists, and vehicles affiliated with the State Parks and museums/concessionaires). The peak of the island, Mt. Livermore, is 788ft above sea level, with multiple good routes to the top available.

The route suggested below visits the main Immigration Station museum before summitting via Ida Trail and heading back down to Ayala Cove, where the ferry docks, via the Sunset Trail. Ida Trail is quite steep; if you want a more steady route to the top, taking North Ridge Trail from the cove area up to the summit and following the Sunset Trail back down would be a good option that bypasses the Immigration Station.

*At time of writing, the loop road is currently closed between Fort McDowell and the Nike Missile Site, with a signed detour along the Fire Road. If hiking the Perimeter Road, Fort McDowell is located approximately 0.34mi past the detour and will require hiking out and back from that point.*

*For more information about the ferry service to Angel Island, consult the [Golden Gate Ferry website](https://www.goldengate.org/ferry/angel-island-ferry/). There is no alternative service off the island after the last ferry departs; take note of the final ferry service time listed on the website and confirm it when arriving on the island with posted schedules.*
