**Important: EBMUD trails require a Trail Use Permit ($3/day, $10/year). [Purchase online and print at home.](https://www.ebmud.com/recreation/550)**

**Important: Camino Pablo does not have crosswalks. Cross with traffic on Santa Maria Way. Use caution when crossing freeway slip lane.**

Siesta Valley is odd. Part of the water district's land right outside Orinda, the permit requirement and general low population in the immediate surrounding area keeps it quieter than East Bay Park land in the hills closer to Berkeley and Oakland, but the views from the shoulder of the valley are no less impressive. If it weren't for the Wilder Ranch subdivision, you'd barely know you're in the middle of one of the country's biggest metropolitan areas. Despite being right above Highway 24, you'll be treated to the quiet tranquility of prototypical East Bay grasslands, oak trees, and as you get closer and begin to descend into Berkeley, fragrant eucalyptus.
