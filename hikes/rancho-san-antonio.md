Starting at the Foothill College campus, this hike starts off along Moody Rd's sidewalk-trail. Walk up Rhus Ridge Rd until the road turns into a trail, and continue up (and up, and up) to the ridge above. Head along Chamise Trail until you reach the turnoff to head back down into the neighborhood, and walk along the streets back to the parking lot.

For a longer hike, consider heading down Ewing Hill Trail into the Hidden Villa property, where trails can take you down towards their hostel and back to the Moody Rd trail. For a description of that hike, see the [Trailstompers website](http://www.trailstompers.com/hidden-villa-from-foothill-college-trail-run.html). 

**Note: This trail route is unvetted, as getting to the trailhead would be a multiple-hour affair for me.** Exercise common sense, and let me know your experience with the route.
