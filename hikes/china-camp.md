getting-there: Marin Transit 233 serves this stop every day of the week; <a href="https://marintransit.org/routes/233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see Marin Transit website for timetable</a>. From San Francisco, Golden Gate Transit 130 provides the best transfer, arriving 20 minutes before each 233. From the East Bay, transfers are poor in each direction (two weekday transfers and no weekend transfers under 40 minutes).

China Camp State Park is located where a ridgeline juts out into the Bay, forming part of the strait between the San Francisco and San Pablo Bays. The park is named for the historic Chinese shrimp-fishing village whose remnants remain at the park's beach, but the park also features wide views from its ridge, calm forests, and plenty of estuary lands.

The trailhead most convenient to transit is located 20 minutes from the bus *along a road with minimal shoulder*. 

Once in the park, any number of loop options are available, from a short walk around the foot of the hills to a 10+ mile loop of the entire park. My personal favorite is the Bay View Trail, but one of the delightful things about this park is the contrast of the hills and the wetlands.
