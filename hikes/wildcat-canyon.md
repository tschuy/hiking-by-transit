AC Transit 70/74 serve the closest bus stop, but the 72/72R are also not too far away. There are walk-in trailheads on Arlington Lane that aren't marked, or you can enter at the main Alvarado Staging Area.

Wildcat Canyon offers hikes at all levels and abilities. The main entrance opens onto Wildcat Canyon Parkway, which is a flat, formerly-paved road. Eventually, it turns into a still quite flat gravel fire road that you could follow all the way up to Tilden Regional Park. Alternatively, if you're looking for views and some altitude gain, upon entering, take the Belgum Trail up to the ridge trail, where you'll be treated to classic [East Bay views](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.9524943,-122.2950379,3a,75y,156.83h,87.98t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipN26W1SNiWUbD3E_KZRU75msA44BSq3PS9LJoz1!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipN26W1SNiWUbD3E_KZRU75msA44BSq3PS9LJoz1%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya282.72617-ro0-fo100!7i11264!8i5632) of grassland, shrubland, and the Bay.
